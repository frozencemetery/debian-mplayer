"Performance of MPlayer depends heavily on hardware - this means that it may "
"benefit from tweaking options, for every single machine it's installed to. "
"You may wish to read the documentation (it is in package 'mplayer-doc', "
"under /share/doc/mplayer-doc/). This DebcConf interface will help you setup "
"just few main features; you may wish to add to /etc/mplayer/mplayer.conf "
"some more refined options (to enable multichannel audio, or video "
"postprocessing, etc etc); and any user similarly may customize MPlayer using "

"On older kernels MPlayer can use the RTC (Real Time Clock) to provide for "
"better timing in reproduction, with less CPU cost; to this end, though, the "
"device /dev/rtc must be accessible to group audio, and the default max-user-"
"freq must be raised to 1024.  Any needed change must be done by root.  If "
"you wish, MPlayer will automatically do this at boot, so that any user can "
"enjoy this feature. Note that there may be security issues with this "
"(although none are known now)."
