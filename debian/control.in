Description: the ultimate movie player 
 Mplayer is a movie player for LINUX. 
 .
 NOTE: the .tar.gz distributed with Debian does not contain all of the upstream
 code. Read README.Debian and copyright for details.
 .
 MPlayer plays most MPEG, VOB, AVI, OGG/OGM, VIVO,
 ASF/WMA/WMV, QT/MOV/MP4, FLI, RM, NuppelVideo, yuv4mpeg, FILM, RoQ, PVA files,
 supported by many native, XAnim, RealPlayer, and Win32 DLL codecs. You can
 watch VideoCD, SVCD, DVD, 3ivx, RealMedia, and DivX movies too.
 .
 Another big feature of MPlayer is the wide range of supported output
 drivers.  It works with X11, Xv, DGA, OpenGL, SVGAlib, fbdev,
 AAlib(*), DirectFB, but you can also use SDL and GGI(*) (and this way
 all their drivers) and some lowlevel card-specific drivers (for
 Matrox, 3Dfx and Radeon, Mach64, Permedia3) too!  Most of them
 supports software or hardware scaling, so you can enjoy movies in
 fullscreen.  MPlayer supports also displaying through some hardware MPEG
 decoder boards, such as the DVB and DXR3/Hollywood+.  
 (*) GGI and  AAlib are not currently compiled by default.
