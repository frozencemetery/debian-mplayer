Description: The Movie Player
 MPlayer is a movie player for GNU/Linux. 
 .
 MPlayer plays most MPEG, VOB, AVI, Ogg/OGM, VIVO,
 ASF/WMA/WMV, QT/MOV/MP4, FLI, RM, NuppelVideo, yuv4mpeg, FILM, RoQ, PVA files,
 supported by many native, XAnim, RealPlayer, and Win32 DLL codecs. You can
 watch VideoCD, SVCD, DVD, 3ivx, RealMedia, and DivX movies too.
 .
 Another big feature of MPlayer is the wide range of supported output
 drivers.  It works with X11, Xv, DGA, OpenGL, SVGAlib, fbdev,
 DirectFB, but also SDL (and this way all its drivers) and some
 lowlevel card-specific drivers (for Matrox, 3Dfx and Radeon, Mach64,
 Permedia3) Most of them supports software or hardware scaling,
 so you can enjoy movies in fullscreen.  MPlayer supports also
 displaying through some hardware MPEG decoder boards, such as the DVB
 and DXR3/Hollywood+.  @DFSG@
